# Hello-world

Greetings fellow comrades!

My name is Kristian and I really want to learn more code. I've scratched the surface using Matlab and Simulink as well as other programs during my bachelorsdegree in electrical engineering. I liked it, but never really mastered it compared to my peers. Hopefully this will be a new starting point for further growth in the field.
